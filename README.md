# 🏦 Loan Approval Predictions  
This project is a machine learning model for predicting loan approval based on various applicant characteristics. It was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate the full Data Science pipeline: from data loading and preprocessing to model training and prediction.  

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `data/` — raw data (`train.csv`, `test.csv`)  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with analysis and modeling  
- `models/` — saved models (if any)  
- `outputs/` — plots, tables, predictions  
- `requirements.txt` — project dependencies  
- `README.md` — documentation  
- `.gitignore` — Git ignore rules
